       " 'Article': 'Export taxes on cocoa beans from Ivory Coast , the world’s biggest producer of the chocolate ingredient, won’t exceed 22 percent of the international price this season, meeting a commitment to the International Monetary Fund , according to a finance ministry document. In the 2008-9 season taxes averaged 25.3 percent of international prices, the IMF said in a document posted on its website in November last year. While the country met the commitment in the season just ended, it had a change in government earlier this year. The rate meets a demand by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to reform the Ivorian cocoa and coffee industries in order to comply with the terms of its Heavily Indebted Poor Countries’ debt-relief program. Last year, the fixed duty on cocoa beans was scrapped and replaced with a levy that varies with prices as part of the reforms that will make the country eligible for $3 billion in debt relief from the Washington-based lenders. The document from the Abidjan-based ministry is dated Oct. 3 and applies to the 2011-12 harvest season, which began on Oct. 1. It was obtained by Bloomberg and hasn’t been publicly released. Norbert Komenan, an adviser to Finance Minister, Charles Koffi Diby, declined to comment when called today. The main export tax has been maintained at 14.6 percent. There are a number of other charges. Cocoa traded at $2,648 a metric ton in New York as of 11:03 a.m. local time. Disputed Election Discussions of the reform strategy with the World Bank are expected to resume in coming months, the IMF said on its website in July, two months after Alassane Ouattara was sworn in as president following a violent five-month political crisis that was sparked by a disputed November election. Cocoa and coffee exports were largely halted during that time, as Ouattara attempted to limit the flow of funds to Laurent Gbagbo , who refused to cede power despite losing the election. Businesses also shut their doors as customers stayed home and banks closed their branches amid the clashes. As many as 3,000 people were killed, according to the International Criminal Court , which is investigating crimes it says were committed by supporters of both leaders. Ivory Coast’s economy may contract 5.8 percent this year before expanding 8.5 percent in 2012, the ministry said last month.

       "'Apple Inc. (AAPL) fans worldwide mourned the death of co-founder Steve Jobs , paying tribute to the man who changed the way they listen to music, use their mobile phones and play on their computers. At Apple’s headquarters -- located at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California -- flags flew at half-staff and bagpipes sounded to the tune of “Amazing Grace” as people placed flowers around a white iPad with a picture of Jobs, who died yesterday at 56, after a battle with cancer. Mourners flocked to Apple stores from New York to Hong Kong , while a crowd gathered in San Francisco ’s Mission Dolores Park for an iPhone-lit vigil. “Part of the narrative that made Apple what it is today goes out with Steve Jobs,” said Christopher Smith, 40, a former business development manager in San Francisco who joined the vigil. “I came out to honor the fact that one man with vision, courage and unwavering dedication can still change the world. The way that I communicate and the way that I interact with the world is through things that Steve Jobs has created.” Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates and Sony Corp. (6758) Chairman Howard Stringer were among leaders who expressed admiration for the man who built the world’s most valuable technology company. President Barack Obama and former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair also issued statements of sympathy. Jobs’s Home “Michelle and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Steve Jobs,” Obama said in a statement. “Steve was among the greatest of American innovators -- brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it.” While Apple plans a celebration for staff, it doesn’t intend to hold a public ceremony, a person familiar with the matter said. Teary-eyed mourners left flowers in front of Jobs’s modest home at the corner of Waverly Street and Santa Rita Avenue in Palo Alto , California. Neighborhood children drew hearts with markers and left them on the ground for others to leave messages. Policemen stood watch, barricading the street. “Here’s a guy who’s a billionaire and lives in a regular neighborhood, not behind a gated estate with all the security guards,” said Bruce Gee, a former Apple employee who drove up to the house from his home a couple miles away. “On Halloween, people go trick or treating there like everyone else.” At the San Francisco Apple store near Union Square, Steve Streza, 24, stood holding an iPad displaying Apple’s homepage image of Jobs and the words “Steve Jobs: 1955-2011.” ‘Regular Guy’ “Macs were the reason I got into product development,” said Streza, a developer at readitlater.com who grew up with Mac computers. “If it weren’t for Steve Jobs and Macs, my life would probably be in a completely different place right now.” Steve Somerstein, who says he met Jobs several times since 1986, recalled the time when he bumped into Jobs while apartment hunting in Palo Alto. “He was just a regular guy,” said Somerstein, who was at the Palo Alto store. “I congratulated him on the company and hoped it was going to do well. I didn’t even own an Apple at that point. He was about 10 years younger than me and just a nice kid.” Ron Kent, a food-truck owner who was at the Palo Alto store, likened Jobs to Michelangelo, the renaissance-era artist who painted the frescoes in the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. “He’s the visionary of our time,” Kent said. ‘RIP Steve Jobs’ Some mourned via social media sites. More than 20 “RIP Steve Jobs” pages sprung up on Facebook within hours of the announced passing of Jobs. News of Jobs’s death slowed the mobile websites of CNN and the Washington Post, according to Keynote Systems Inc. (KEYN) , which tracks website performance. “Steve Jobs,” the biography written by former Time magazine editor Walter Isaacson, scheduled for release Nov. 21, was the best seller on Amazon.com Inc.’s website. In New York, Jared and Alexi Roth, 33 and 31, left two red apples by the wall outside the Apple store on Broadway in the Upper West Side. “We were literally walking by a market on Broadway when Jared got a text saying Steve Jobs died,” Alexi said. “We saw the apples and just thought it would be appropriate.” Across the ocean, Charanis Chiu, walked in front of the Apple store in Hong Kong to place a sunflower, the logo of the photo-viewing application on the iPhone. “A lot of companies such as Microsoft and Nokia are following in his direction,” said Chiu, a vendor of photographic equipment. “Apple will continue to grow as long as they are going in the right direction.” ‘Insanely Great Honor’ At the store in Shanghai ’s Lujiazui district, an area of about three square meters was set aside at the front for people to pay tribute to Jobs. Microsoft’s Gates praised the man who for decades was both a rival and a partner in the personal-computer industry. “The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come,” Gates said. “For those of us lucky enough to get to work with him, it’s been an insanely great honor.\\xa0I will miss Steve immensely.” Stephen Elop, chief executive officer of Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , said the world lost a “true visionary” in Jobs’s passing. Sachio Kitagawa, 45, was on her way with her son to the Apple store in the Ginza shopping district of Tokyo when she heard the news of Jobs’s passing. “He should receive the Nobel prize,” said Kitagawa, who’s used Apple products for 20 years. “I have a second child who is disabled and even he can use the Macintosh. It shows you how user-friendly Apple products are.” ‘Thank You’ Outside the Apple store a short walk from Frankfurt ’s financial institutions, sunflowers, gerbera daisies and roses were laid alongside a burning candle. “He forged designs which appealed to the mass market and developed technology which you can now find in museums -- not because of its age, but because it was groundbreaking,” said Guenther Uttecht, a 60-year-old artist who uses Apple products to work on abstract photos as he left the shop. At the entrance of the store on Regents Street in London lay a white rose with a hand-written note saying “Rip Steve Jobs. With love from Instagramers London and all Instagramers around the world. You gave us life. Thank you x”. Next to it a passerby had left an apple with a bite out of it, imitating the brand’s iconic logo, alongside a bouquet of lillies. On Rue Halevy, just behind Opera Garnier in central Paris, flowers were tucked into the doors of the Apple store. One bouquet had a card from Mario Baluci, the creative artist at Carre Senart, that said, “Thank you, Steve.” In Singapore , Georgina Koh, 30, recalled the man who inspired her to open her own accessory shop. “The world should remember Steve Jobs’s famous quote ‘Stay Hungry, Stay foolish,’” said Koh, a former Apple worker, in reference to Jobs’s Stanford University commencement speech in 2005. “It’s an honor to have been associated with Apple. It is a company built by a man relentless about creating beautiful products that have changed our lives.” To contact the reporters on this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at  dbass2@bloomberg.net ; Douglas Macmillan in New York at  dmacmillan3@bloomberg.net ; Danielle Kucera in New York at  dkucera6@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at  tgiles5@bloomberg.net'"

       "        'Executives and politicians comment on the death of Steve Jobs , the co-founder and former chief executive officer of Apple Inc. (AAPL) : Bill Gates, chairman and founder of Microsoft Corp. “I’m truly saddened to learn of Steve Jobs’s death. Melinda and I extend our sincere condolences to his family and friends, and to everyone Steve has touched through his work. “Steve and I first met nearly 30 years ago, and have been colleagues, competitors and friends over the course of more than half our lives. “The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come. “For those of us lucky enough to get to work with him, it’s been an insanely great honor. I will miss Steve immensely.” U.S. President Barack Obama. “Steve was among the greatest of American innovators -- brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it. “By building one of the planet’s most successful companies from his garage, he exemplified the spirit of American ingenuity. By making computers personal and putting the Internet in our pockets, he made the information revolution not only accessible, but intuitive and fun. And by turning his talents to storytelling, he has brought joy to millions of children and grownups alike. Steve was fond of saying that he lived every day like it was his last. Because he did, he transformed our lives, redefined entire industries, and achieved one of the rarest feats in human history: he changed the way each of us sees the world. “The world has lost a visionary. And there may be no greater tribute to Steve’s success than the fact that much of the world learned of his passing on a device he invented. Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to Steve’s wife Laurene, his family, and all those who loved him.” Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple. “It felt a lot like you just heard that John Lennon got shot, or JFK, or Martin Luther King. “He was one of those cool guys. He knew technology. He understood it. We talked about the philosophies of the day --the counterculture was strong, the hippy movement, words in songs -- and went to concerts together. It was a strong friendship. “I think most people are going to miss the great products. That’s why we are stunned so much. It’s going to be hard to sleep tonight.” Mark Zuckerberg, founder and chief executive officer of Facebook Inc. “Steve, thank you for being a mentor and a friend. Thanks for showing that what you build can change the world. I will miss you.” Jim Snabe and Bill McDermott , co-CEOs of SAP AG. “Our world has lost a visionary, a creator, and a good person. Steve Jobs always challenged assumptions, went for the impossible and pursued perfection. He set the standard for innovation: breakthrough ideas realized at nearly unlimited scale. His light will shine on and influence generations to come.” Hans Vestberg, CEO of Ericsson AB. “Our industry has lost a great visionary and inspirer. With his innovative thinking Jobs was part of creating the massive growth in smartphone usage we are seeing today.” Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP Plc. “Steve Jobs was a unique and brilliantly successful entrepreneur and manager -- a very rare combination and an inspiration to all of us. The most outstanding entrepreneur and manager of his generation. He was remarkable also in being able to bounce back from adversity -- the true test of a business genius. He was also an instinctive marketeer with an intuitive understanding of what the customer wants, of design, of product and of marketing. By virtue of being unique, he is by definition irreplaceable.” Neelie Kroes, the European Union’s commissioner for digital affairs. “A visionary who changed the way we live and work.” John Chambers, CEO of Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  “The world lost a true visionary and great man today. Steve Jobs did more than simply shape our concepts of technology and invention, he helped define our understanding of how great innovation and design can bring people closer together. “I, and everyone at Cisco, are deeply saddened by Steve’s loss. Our deepest sympathies go out to his colleagues and family. We’ll miss you, Steve, but your legacy will continue forever.” Meg Whitman, CEO of Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  “Steve Jobs was an iconic entrepreneur and businessman whose impact on technology was felt beyond Silicon Valley. He will be remembered for the innovation he brought to market and the inspiration he brought to the world.” Robert Iger, CEO of Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  “Steve Jobs was a great friend as well as a trusted adviser. His legacy will extend far beyond the products he created or the businesses he built. “It will be the millions of people he inspired, the lives he changed, and the culture he defined. Steve was such an ‘original,’ with a thoroughly creative, imaginative mind that defined an era. Despite all he accomplished, it feels like he was just getting started. “With his passing the world has lost a rare original, Disney has lost a member of our family, and I have lost a great friend. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Laurene and his children during this difficult time.” Larry Page, CEO of Google Inc. (GOOG)  “I am very, very sad to hear the news about Steve. He was a great man with incredible achievements and amazing brilliance. “He always seemed to be able to say in very few words what you actually should have been thinking before you thought it. “His focus on the user experience above all else has always been an inspiration to me. He was very kind to reach out to me as I became CEO of Google and spend time offering his advice and knowledge even though he was not at all well. “My thoughts and Google’s are with his family and the whole Apple family.” Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google. “From the earliest days of Google, whenever Larry and I sought inspiration for vision and leadership, we needed to look no farther than Cupertino. “Steve, your passion for excellence is felt by anyone who has ever touched an Apple product (including the Macbook I am writing this on right now). And I have witnessed it in person the few times we have met. “On behalf of all of us at Google and more broadly in technology, you will be missed very much. My condolences to family, friends, and colleagues at Apple.” Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM)  “Steve Jobs was the greatest leader our industry has ever known. We are all blessed by his life. My thoughts and prayers are with his family. “I am really sad. It’s such a terrible loss for the whole world. I will never forget him. He did so much for me.” Guy Kawasaki, who served as an “evangelist” for Apple’s Macintosh computer when it was introduced in 1984 and is a founder of Garage Technology Ventures in Palo Alto, California. “No CEO ever has done more for his customers, shareholders and employees than Steve Jobs.” Michael Dell, CEO of Dell Inc. (DELL)  “Today the world lost a visionary leader, the technology industry lost an iconic legend and I lost a friend and fellow founder. “The legacy of Steve Jobs will be remembered for generations to come. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family and to the Apple team.” Scott McGregor, CEO of Broadcom Corp. (BRCM)  “Steve’s passion for innovation and creativity will carry on for decades to come. “His legacy is enormous, touching millions of people around the world. Our entire industry and economy is better for his presence and incredible contributions. “On behalf of Broadcom, we send our deepest condolences to Steve’s family and to Apple employees.” Jay Elliot, author of “The Steve Jobs Way” who worked at Apple with Jobs for six years. “It’s very sad. I can’t believe it. I’ve been preparing for it as we’ve all known it’s coming. But he was a unique person who we’ll never see or meet again. “He changed my life. He lived in a direct way, the way he wanted. Some people criticize him but I worked for him for many years and he was a very moral individual.” Choi Gee Sung, CEO of Samsung Electronics Co. “Samsung Electronics is saddened to hear of Chairman Steve Jobs’s passing and would like to extend our deepest condolences. “Chairman Steve Jobs introduced numerous revolutionary changes to the information technology industry and was a great entrepreneur. “His innovative spirit and remarkable accomplishments will forever be remembered by people around the world. “We would like to again express our sincerest condolences to Mr. Jobs’s family and his colleagues.” Maria Shriver, former first lady of California. “I’m going to turn off my Apple computer, iPhone and iPad tonight at 8 p.m. and honor Steve with a moment of digital silence. Will you join me?” Jim Allchin, former chief architect of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Windows operating system. “In my view Steve’s contributions to society grew over time and, although he was always innovative, his best work came during the last 10 years. Steve’s ability to understand user- centric computing was the best I have ever seen. He was a truly remarkable man.” California Governor Jerry Brown. “Steve Jobs was a great California innovator who demonstrated what a totally independent and creative mind can accomplish. “Few people have made such a powerful and elegant imprint on our lives. Anne and I wish to express our deepest sympathy to Steve’s wife, Laurene, and their entire family.” Jeff Bewkes , Time Warner Inc. (TWX) CEO. “The entire Time Warner family mourns the loss of Steve Jobs. The world is a better place because of Steve, and the stories our company tells have been made richer by the products he created. “He was a dynamic and fearless competitor, collaborator, and friend. In a society that has seen incredible technological innovation during our lifetimes, Steve may be the one true icon whose legacy will be remembered for a thousand years.” Rupert Murdoch, chairman and founder of News Corp. “Today, we lost one of the most influential thinkers, creators and entrepreneurs of all time. “Steve Jobs was simply the greatest CEO of his generation. While I am deeply saddened by his passing, I’m reminded of the stunning impact he had in revolutionizing the way people consume media and entertainment. “My heart goes out to his family and to everyone who had the opportunity to work beside him in bringing his many visions to life.” Mike Bloomberg, mayor of New York City and founder of Bloomberg LP, owner of Bloomberg News. “Tonight, America lost a genius who will be remembered with Edison and Einstein, and whose ideas will shape the world for generations to come. “Again and again over the last four decades, Steve Jobs saw the future and brought it to life long before most people could even see the horizon. And Steve’s passionate belief in the power of technology to transform the way we live brought us more than smartphones and iPads: It brought knowledge and power that is reshaping the face of civilization. “In New York City’s government, everyone from street construction inspectors to NYPD detectives have harnessed Apple’s products to do their jobs more efficiently and intuitively. “Tonight our city\\xa0-- a city that has always had such respect and admiration for creative genius -- joins with people around the planet in remembering a great man and keeping Laurene and the rest of the Jobs family in our thoughts and prayers.” Yang Yuanqing, CEO of Lenovo Group Ltd. (992)  “Today the world lost one of its greatest innovators and visionaries with the passing of Steve Jobs. His achievements are unmatched in our time. “Steve led this industry like a beacon for the past decade. As a competitor, he helped ensure all of us pushed even harder, and I am confident his legacy will continue to energize the industry for many years to come. “We admired his spirit, his creativity and his passion. He not only changed the technology industry, he changed the world and made it better. “While we will all feel this enormous loss, I am confident that this industry will take to heart the lessons Steve taught us about innovation.” Howard Stringer, chairman of Sony Corp. (6758)  “The digital age has lost its leading light, but Steve’s innovations and creativity will inspire dreamers and thinkers for generations.” Morris Chang, chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. “We have lost a true visionary. Steve Jobs changed the face of computing and defined the shape of mobile computing devices. He had created an unparalleled example of what innovation can do. It saddens me to think of how much more he had to offer the world. He will be missed deeply.” George Lucas, chairman of Lucasfilm Ltd. “The magic of Steve was that while others simply accepted the status quo, he saw the true potential in everything he touched and never compromised on that vision. “He leaves behind an incredible family and a legacy that will continue to speak to people for years to come.” John Lasseter, chief creative officer and president of Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios. “Steve Jobs was an extraordinary visionary, our very dear friend and the guiding light of the Pixar family. “He saw the potential of what Pixar could be before the rest of us, and beyond what anyone ever imagined. Steve took a chance on us and believed in our crazy dream of making computer animated films; the one thing he always said was to simply ‘make it great.’ “He is why Pixar turned out the way we did and his strength, integrity and love of life has made us all better people. He will forever be a part of Pixar’s DNA. Our hearts go out to his wife Laurene and their children during this incredibly difficult time.” Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie, co-CEOs of Research In Motion Ltd. “Steve Jobs was a great visionary and a respected competitor. We extend our deepest condolences to his family and to all of the employees of Apple.” Paul Otellini, president and CEO of Intel Corp. “True genius is measured by the ability to touch every person on the planet. Steve did that, not just once, but many, many times over his amazing life. We at Intel were privileged to have known him and worked with him as he brought his creations to life. Our hearts go out to his family and to his many friends and co-creators throughout the world.” Stephen Elop, CEO of Nokia Oyj. (NOK1V)  “The world lost a true visionary today.

He never was into money or measured his life through owning stuff. “The world knows Steve Jobs as the brilliant genius who transformed technology into magic. A part of Steve still lives within all of us through his beautifully designed products and his no-compromises media experiences. Steve Jobs captured our imagination with his creativity. His legacy is far more than being the greatest CEO ever. A world leader is dead, but the lessons his leadership taught us live on.” Paul Jacobs, CEO of Qualcomm Inc. “We have all lost someone special today. “I had a number of opportunities to meet and talk with Steve Jobs over the years. He was always a bold visionary and a risk taker, and a tough businessman as well. “The products and technologies he and his team at Apple worked on will continue to influence the wireless industry and people’s everyday lives for many years to come. I offer my condolences to his family, friends and the employees of Apple.” Terry Gou, chairman of Foxconn Technology Group. “The world has lost a true hero and I have lost a friend whose dedication to his company, his customers, and our industry is reflected in the fact that he continued to work while dealing with such a devastating illness. “True business leaders grow their companies by committing their innovation, creativity, and passion and, while Steve exemplified all of these qualities, he also committed his heart to building a company and products that enriched people’s lives. “Steve’s spirit will live on forever with those who, like me, had the honor to know and work with him. However, everyone has been touched by his genius and, because of this, he has left the world a better place. He will be missed, but never forgotten.” Masayoshi Son, CEO of Softbank Corp. “I am deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Steve Jobs. Steve was truly a genius of our time, a man with a rare ability to fuse art and technology. “Centuries from now, he will be remembered alongside Leonardo da Vinci. His achievements will continue to shine forever.” Randall Stephenson, CEO of AT&T Inc. “We are saddened by the passing of Steve Jobs.

All of us at AT&T offer our thoughts and prayers to Steve’s wife, family, and his Apple family.” Lowell McAdam, CEO of Verizon Communications Inc. “Steve Jobs devoted his ceaseless energy and creative genius to technology innovation that changed the world time and time again.

His approach and way of working will characterize Apple for a long time to come.” Jeffrey Immelt, CEO of General Electric Co. “He did something that I think is very hard: be both a dreamer and a doer.” Tony Blair, the former U.K. prime minister. “Steve was an extraordinary and creative human being, an inspiration and an innovator who believed that by the power of ideas the world could be transformed. As much as anyone in any walk of life in the early 21st century he changed people’s lives simply by imagination and determination. His memory will serve as a symbol of what the human mind can achieve.” Ratan Tata, Tata Group Chairman. “Steve Jobs has been one of the greatest icons of the modern era. His untimely death is a huge loss to us all. “His creativity, innovativeness and unbelievable attention to detail in every single area, gave the world the early personal computer, the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad which have perhaps brought about the greatest change in the way people wirelessly listen to music, view visual images, exchange data and communicate. “He has changed the way of life of many. Apple’s products, under his leadership, have had a profound impact on mankind, unequaled by any other company in the information and technology space. “The world has lost a great business leader and a great visionary. He will be deeply mourned and greatly missed.” To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at  tgiles5@bloomberg.net',\n",
       "        'Apple Inc. (AAPL) security officials met with police in Palo Alto , California , this week to notify them that Steve Jobs was close to death, a spokeswoman with the police department said. Following the meeting, the police devised a plan to put patrols in the area around the former Apple chief executive officer’s Palo Alto home once they heard from the company that he had died, according to Sandra Brown, the spokeswoman. The Apple representatives told the police department there was “a possibility that it could happen this week,” Brown said in a phone interview. “It’s common sense for us to work together. If you think about who he was and his contribution to the world, people might come out in masses.” Jobs, who resigned as Apple’s CEO on Aug. 24, died Oct. 5, the Cupertino, California-based company said. Jobs, 56, had been diagnosed in 2003 with a neuroendocrine tumor, a rare form of pancreatic cancer, and underwent a liver transplant in 2009. Apple unveiled the latest version of its iPhone, the product that accounts for almost half of the company’s sales, on Oct. 4, the day before his death. Steve Dowling, an Apple spokesman, declined to comment about the police meeting. Jobs lived in a home that was modest, for a person of his means, on a public street open to pedestrians and traffic. The extra patrols were necessary for safety reasons, Brown said. ‘Compounds and Walls’ “There are other people here in town, they have compounds and walls,” said Brown. “He didn’t want to have security around.” Apple was supposed to inform the police of Jobs’s death before making a public announcement so the department could prepare, said Brown. Instead, police learned he had died when the company issued a press release at about 4:30 p.m. local time on Oct. 5. As it turned out, Brown said, only about 40 people showed up around Jobs’s home that day. “Here’s a guy who’s a billionaire and lives in a regular neighborhood, not behind a gated estate with all the security guards,” said Bruce Gee, a former Apple employee who drove up from his home a couple miles away. “On Halloween, people go trick or treating there like everyone else.” Mourners gathered at Apple stores around the world and took to the Internet and social media to express their grief. At the San Francisco Apple store near Union Square, Steve Streza, 24, stood holding an iPad displaying Apple’s homepage image of Jobs and the words “Steve Jobs: 1955-2011.” “Macs were the reason I got into product development,” said Streza, a developer at readitlater.com who grew up with Mac computers. “If it weren’t for Steve Jobs and Macs, my life would probably be in a completely different place right now.” To contact the reporter on this story: Karen Gullo in San Francisco at  kgullo@bloomberg.net.

He knew technology, he understood it. We talked about the philosophies of the day, the hippy movement, words in songs and went to concerts together. It was a strong friendship. “‘Technology was happening on the side.
